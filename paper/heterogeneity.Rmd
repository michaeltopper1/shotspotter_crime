\section{Heterogeneity}\label{section:hetereogeneity}

\subsection{Is ShotSpotter most hindering in resource-constrained times?}\label{section:resourceconstrain}
As alluded to in [Table 2], ShotSpotter has a larger effect on response times when officer are resource constrained.
In fact, days with fewer officers working has as much as three times as large of treatment effect than days with more officers.
This is consistent with the hypothesis that times where an officer is resource constrained are more likely to be affected by the increased workload that ShotSpotter causes.
We further test this conclusion in Figure \ref{hetero_resource} where we show several other splits based on officer resources.

In the left column, days are separated by the number of 911 dispatches per day.
Days with a large number of dispatches represent days with higher crime levels.
These high crime days show evidence of a larger increase in both Call-to-Dispatch time and Call-to-On-Scene time.
Next, in the right column, dispatches are split based on the time of day that they occur, using the 3 Watches that officers work.
Similarly, Watch 3 that operates during the evening, and which faces the highest levels of crime, see the largest treatment effect of each of the three watches.


NOTE TO HEATHER: we feel like this is kind of weak evidence, but it fits in with our story.




\subsection{How does ShotSpotter affect other priority response times?}\label{section:priorities}

Figure \ref{priorities_dispatch} explore treatment effect heterogeneity by call type for the five most common call types.
Each bar represents a separate regression where the outcome is the Call-to-Dispatch time for a specific type of call.
It is important to explore individual call types for several reasons.
First, any change in the distribution of call types could lead to a change in response time that is unrelated to Shotspotter technology. This would arise as some call types require more officer time.
Second, as a placebo test, we can explore whether time sensitive calls, such as \textit{Battery in Progress}, are more affected than non-time sensitive calls, such as \textit{Parking Violation}.

There is not a significant amount of heterogeneity by call type for Priority 1 calls.
All Priority 1 call show increases in Call-to-Dispatch time, consistent with the idea that all priority 1 calls are time sensitive and immediately dispatched if an officer is available.
This helps to ensure that previous results are not driven by a change in the distribution of call types.

Priority 2 calls also see an increase in their Call-to-Dispatch times of a similar magnitude as Priority 1 calls.
However, since these calls have a longer average time, the effect size is smaller relative to the mean.
The lowest priority level (3) sees no change across any of the reported call types.

Figure \ref{priorities_onscene} provides similar estimates to [Figure 7] but for Call-to-On-Scene time as the outcome.
Across the 4 most common call types, we find a increase in the Call-to-On-Scene time by by approximately 1 minute over that of Call-to-Dispatch time.
This result mirrors that of the aggregated estimates, that not only officers are being dispatched slower, but they are also arriving slower to the scene after being dispatched.
Similar to Call-to-Dispatch time, Call-to-On-Scene time for Priority 3 calls is unaffected.
