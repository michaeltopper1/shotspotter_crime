# Research Overview

Technology is integral to police departments, automating officer tasks, but inherently changing their time allocation. We investigate this by studying ShotSpotter, a technology that automates gunfire detection. Following a detection, officers are dispatched to the scene, thereby reallocating their time. We leverage this shock to officersâ€™ time allocation using the rollout of ShotSpotter across Chicago police districts to study the effects on 911 call response. We find substantial consequences---officers are dispatched to calls slower (23\%), arrive on-scene later (13\%), and the probability of arrest is decreased 9\%. Consequently, police departments must evaluate their resource capacities prior to implementing technologies.

# Project Objective

The objective of this project is to be a published journal article.  Moreover, this will be a chapter in Michael's dissertation, and possibly Toshio's as well.

# Proposal Narrative

Please see the most recent draft of the working paper which can be found [here](https://michaeltopper.netlify.app/research/jmp_michael_topper.pdf) for all details on the methodology.

# Schedule of Project

This project has been completed and is now awaiting journal submission.

# Detailed Budget

The budget for this proposal is **$200.00.** It is a one-time payment for the journal submission fee at AEJ: Policy. It will be paid at soonest convenience to the Economics Department, although a proposed date is **Friday, April 11, 2024.**
