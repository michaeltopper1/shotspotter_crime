\item \textit{Note: } 
\item All descriptions are from confirmed 911 dispatches that resulted                       in an injury. Time-Insensitive 911 dispatches are those in which                       an injury has likely been realized prior to an officer dispatch.                       On the other hand, Time-Sensitive dispatches are those in which                       a victim may avoid injury if an officer can rapidly respond in time                       to intervene.
