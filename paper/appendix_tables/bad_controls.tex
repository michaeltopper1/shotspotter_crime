\item Standard errors are clustered by district.                      This table shows estimations on two outcome variables,                       Number 911 Dispatches and Officer Hours, which are not                      included in the main specification due to possibly being                      bad controls.                      Each panel refers to a distinct outcome variable.                  Number 911 Dispatches is the number of 911 dispatches.                  Officer Hours is the number of police officer hours.                  ShotSpotter Activated refers to the                  timing in which each district receives ShotSpotter technology. The                  Gardner (2022) estimator is robust to the heterogeneous                  treatment effects in staggered two-way-fixed-effects designs.
