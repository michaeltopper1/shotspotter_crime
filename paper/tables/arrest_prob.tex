\item Standard errors are clustered by district.                   Panel A shows Arrest Rate defined as the number of arrests made                  divided by the number of dispatches, while Panel B shows Injury defined as the                  number of injury-related dispatches divided by the number of dispatches that are time-sensitive (see Appendix Figure BLANK).                   Columns 2 and 3 subset Column 1 by gun-related and non-gun-related arrest rates and injury rates.                  Gun-related crimes for Arrest Rate are those corresponding to a person with a gun,                  shots fired, or a person shot. Gun-related crimes to Injury Rate corresponds to                  person with gun or shots fired.                  Columns 3-5 report the                   top 3 most frequent calls that end in arrests: Domestic Battery,                  Domestic Disturbance, and Battery. Observations are not consistent across each                  call type since not every type of call occurs on every district-day. Controls                  of officer hours and number of dispatches                  are included in all specifications.
