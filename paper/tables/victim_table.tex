\item Standard errors are clustered by district.                       The main outcome variable is the probability of a victim being                      injured.                      The sample here is restricted to only Priority 1 dispatches that                      are time-sensitive and have the possibility of an injury. For instance,                      a dispatch for a person shot is not time sensitive since                      the injury has already been realized. On the other                      hand, a dispatch for a person with a knife is considered time-sensitive as                      an injury has not yet occurred, but may occur if an officer arrives slower.                      The Pooled column refers to using the entire sample of time-sensitive Priority 1                      dispatches.                      Gun Dispatch is restricted to only time-sensitive gun dispatches including                      'Person with a Gun' and 'Shots Fired'. Non-Gun Dispatch are all other                      time-sensitive dispatches. In all columns the preferred specification is estimated using                      OLS.                   .
