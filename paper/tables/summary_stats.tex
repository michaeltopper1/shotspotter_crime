\item \textit{Note: } 
\item Units are in seconds unless otherwise noted. Data is at         the call-level. Call-to-Dispatch represents          the amount of time from the 911 call to an officer dispatching         to the scene. Call-to-On-Scene is the time from a 911 call to         when an officer arrives on scene.         Call-to-On-Scene is missing approximately 45 percent         of on-scene times. This is discussed further in Appendix A.         Arrest Probability is the probability of         an arrest occuring during a dispatch.         Victim Injury Probability is the probability of a victim being injured         during a time-sensitive dispatch call. A time-sensitive dispatch call is one         in which the injury outcome has not yet been realized.         Priority 1 refers to an immediate dispatch,          Priority 2 a rapid dispatch, and Priority 3 a routine dispatch. Officer Hours are the          number of working hours sworn police officers work at the district-day level.          Number of Dispatches is the number of Priority 1 dispatches at the         district-day level.         Number of SST Dispatches is the          number of dispatches due to ShotSpotter alerts. Importantly, Number of SST Dispatches is         also at the district-by-day level and includes days in which         ShotSpotter is not implemented. The average daily number of ShotSpotter dispatches across Chicago         once all 12 districts have implemented ShotSpotter is approximately 60. Note that         New Years Eve/New Years Day/Fourth of July are excluded from the sample as         ShotSpotter alerts can be as high as 392 on these days.
