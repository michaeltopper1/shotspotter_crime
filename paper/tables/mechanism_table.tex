\item Standard errors are clustered by district.                       ShotSpotter Activated is a binary equal to one when                      a district has ShotSpotter technology (extensive margin).                      Number SST Dispatches refers to the number of                      ShotSpotter dispatches that occur within a district-day (intensive margin).                      All coefficient estimates are in seconds. Panel A reports results for                      Call-to-Dispatch while Panel B reports results for Call-to-On-Scene.                      Officer availability is measured by number of officer hours within a district-day.                       Column 2 corresponds to district-days that have officer hours above                      their district median (more officer availability), while Column 3 corresponds to district-days that                      have officer hours below their district median (less officer availability). Analyses for                       Columns 1-3 are on the extensive margin, and utilze call-level data. The coefficients for these analyses                      are interpreted as average effects. Analysis for Column 4                      is on the intensive margin, and the data is aggregated to the district-day level. The                      coefficients of interest for Column 4 are interpreted as marginal effects. We                      aggregate to the district-day since the number of ShotSpotter dispatches is measured                      at the district-day. Because of this, we                      cannot use call-level data to correctly identify the marginal effects. Moreover,                      we restrict the sample to only post-implementation days for treated districts to                      ensure that only the intensive margin, rather than extensive margin, is identified. Further explanation                       of this model is                      given in Section 5.3.
