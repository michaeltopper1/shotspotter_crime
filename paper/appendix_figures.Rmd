\caption{Map of ShotSpotter Districts in Chicago \label{map}}
\textit{Note:} There are 22 police districts in Chicago, and 12 are equipt with ShotSpotter technology. Each district contains beat which are designated by the boxes within the district lines. ShotSpotter implmentation began in January 2017 and ended in May 2018.

\caption{Robustness of Main Results \label{forest_sample_plot}}
\textit{Note:} This figure shows the results from estimation of Equation 1 with six different samples for both Call-to-Dispatch and Call-to-On-Scene. Main Sample refers to the main sample used in the paper. Omitting 2020 uses the main specification in the paper, but omits the year 2020 due to Covid-19.  Omitting Shots Fired omits any 911 call dispatches related to the description of Shots Fired in case dispatchers begin combining reports of gun fire with ShotSpotter alerts. Including Outliers includes all outliers that are removed from the main analysis (+3 standard deviations from the mean). Official Activate Dates uses the official ShotSpotter activation dates as received from a Freedom of Information Request from the Chicago Police Department. These dates are similar, but not exact to the dates we use due to what we observe in the data. Last, Omitting Never-Treated uses the full sample, but omits any police districts that did not receive ShotSpotter technology.

\caption{Leave-One-Out Analysis \label{loo_figure}}
\textit{Note:} This figure shows the results from 22 distinct OLS and Gardner (2022) regressions using Equation 1. Both outcomes of Call-to-Dispatch and Call-to-On-Scene are pictured. In each iteration, one police district is removed from estimation to ensure that the effects of ShotSpotter are not driven by one district. The blue points and errorbars represent Garnder (2022) point estimates and 95\% confidence intervals, which are robust to hetereogeneous treatment effects in staggered designs. The red points and lines denote point estimates and 95\% confidence intervals from OLS estimates. Standard errors are clustered at the district level. The dashed blue lines represent the average estimate under the Gardner (2022) estimate while the dashed red lines indicate the average estimate using OLS.

Main Sample (2-Stage DID) uses the main sample, but uses the 2-Stage DID estimation technique as outlined in Gardner (2022). No Controls omits all controls, yet keeps day-by-month-by year and district fixed effects. Omitting 2020 uses the main specification in the paper, but omits the year 2020 due to Covid-19.

\caption{Sensitivity Analysis of Pre-Trends \label{roth_dispatch}}
\textit{Note:} This figure shows sensitivity analysis of the event study plot in Figure BLANK. The x-axis shows the maximum change in slope of pre-trends across consecutive periods (M). We gradually increase M where M = 0 corresponds to allowing a linear trend and M > 0 allows for increasingly more varied nonlinear trends. In red, the average of the post-implementation periods are plotted. In blue, alternative Fixed-Length Confidence Intervals (FLCI), averaged over all post-implementation periods,  that are proposed by Rambachan and Roth (2022) are plotted which relaxes the parallel trends assumption and requires only that differential trends evolve smoothly over time. Note that here, the breakdown value is 0.4 which means the significant effects observed in the post-implementation periods are only valid if we allow for the change in slope of the pre-period to change by no more than 0.4.
