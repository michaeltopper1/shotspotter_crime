\caption{Map of ShotSpotter Districts in Chicago \label{map}}
\textit{Note:} There are 22 police districts in Chicago, and 12 are equipt with ShotSpotter technology. Each district contains beat which are designated by the boxes within the district lines. ShotSpotter implmentation began in January 2017 and ended in May 2018.

\caption{Robustness of Main Results \label{forest_sample_plot}}
\textit{Note:} This figure shows the results from estimation of Equation 1 with six different samples for both Call-to-Dispatch and Call-to-On-Scene. Main Sample refers to the main sample used in the paper. Omitting 2020 uses the main specification in the paper, but omits the year 2020 due to Covid-19.  Omitting Shots Fired omits any 911 call dispatches related to the description of Shots Fired in case dispatchers begin combining reports of gun fire with ShotSpotter alerts. Including Outliers includes all outliers that are removed from the main analysis (+3 standard deviations from the mean). Official Activate Dates uses the official ShotSpotter activation dates as received from a Freedom of Information Request from the Chicago Police Department. These dates are similar, but not exact to the dates we use due to what we observe in the data. Next, we include July 4th, New Years Eve, and New Years day, which are excluded from the preferred sample since there may be many false-positive reports of gunfire. Last, Omitting Never-Treated uses the full sample, but omits any police districts that did not receive ShotSpotter technology.

\caption{Leave-One-Out Analysis \label{loo_figure}}
\textit{Note:} This figure shows the results from 22 distinct OLS and Gardner (2022) regressions using Equation 1. Both outcomes of Call-to-Dispatch and Call-to-On-Scene are pictured. In each iteration, one police district is removed from estimation to ensure that the effects of ShotSpotter are not driven by one district. The blue points and errorbars represent Garnder (2022) point estimates and 95\% confidence intervals, which are robust to hetereogeneous treatment effects in staggered designs. The red points and lines denote point estimates and 95\% confidence intervals from OLS estimates. Standard errors are clustered at the district level. The dashed blue lines represent the average estimate under the Gardner (2022) estimate while the dashed red lines indicate the average estimate using OLS.
