	abstract = {Recent health care consolidation trends raise the important policy question whether improved emergency medical services and enhanced productivity can offset adverse quality effects from decreased access. This paper empirically analyzes how geographical distance from an emergency hospital affects the probability of surviving an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), accounting for health-based spatial sorting and data limitations on out-of-hospital mortality. Exploiting policy-induced variation in hospital distance derived from emergency hospital closures and detailed Swedish mortality data over two decades, results show a drastically decreasing probability of surviving an AMI as residential distance from a hospital increases one year after a closure occurred. The effect disappears in subsequent years, however, suggesting that involved agents quickly adapted to the new environment.},

	abstract = {This study examines the effectiveness of an Acoustic Gunshot Location System in reducing gun-crime problems in St Louis, MO. Acoustic Gunshot Location Systems (AGLSs) triangulate the location of acoustic waves produced by gunfire and send automated signals to law enforcement officials, reducing the response time of police. Manufacturers of AGLS claim these systems can reduce gun problems in high crime locations, but to date no systematic review has taken place. This study addresses this issue by conducting a quasi-experimental study of an acoustic systems’ impact on reported levels of ‘shots fired’ and gun crimes. Results of interrupted time-series analysis indicate that the AGLS in St Louis, MO, may be related to a drop in citizen reports of ‘shots fired’. The current study fails to find an impact on reported gun crimes, however. Policy implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of technologies has led police departments to adopt new physical security systems to manage violent crimes. This study evaluates the implementation of a gunshot detection system in an urban neighborhood plagued by high rates of violent crime in southeast Massachusetts. Data were collected from the police dispatch log of a southeastern Massachusetts city employing the technology; the research design then evaluated the impact of the Shotspotter™ system on the ability of the police to more effectively identify, investigate, and prosecute gun-involved crimes. This study utilized a quasi-experimental design confirming positive outcomes in police response and dispatch times, but not except case resolutions. Future research may need to establish a refined measurement on case resolution variable to clearly reflect its constructs considering the police investigation process.},
