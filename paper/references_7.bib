	abstract = {Instrumental variable (IV) strategies are widely used in political science to establish causal relationships, but the identifying assumptions required by an IV design are demanding, and assessing their validity remains challenging. In this paper, we replicate 67 papers published in three top political science journals from 2010-2022 and identify several concerning patterns. First, researchers often overestimate the strength of their instruments due to non-i.i.d. error structures such as clustering. Second, the commonly used t-test for two-stage-least-squares (2SLS) estimates frequently underestimates uncertainty. Using more robust inferential methods, we ﬁnd that about 19-30\% of the 2SLS estimates in our sample are underpowered. Third, in most replicated studies, 2SLS estimates are signiﬁcantly larger than ordinary-least-squares estimates, with their ratio negatively correlated with instrument strength in studies with non-experimentally generated instruments, suggesting potential violations of unconfoundedness or exclusion restriction. We provide a checklist and software to help researchers avoid these pitfalls and improve their practice.},

Our test statistic is a scaled nonrobust first-stage F statistic. Instruments are considered weak when the two-stage least squares or the limited information maximum likelihood Nagar bias is large relative to a benchmark. We apply our procedures to the estimation of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, where our test cannot reject the null of weak instruments in a larger number of countries than the test proposed by Stock and Yogo in 2005.

	abstract = {A method is given for estimating the coefficients of a single equation in a complete system of linear stochastic equations (see expression (2.1)), provided that a number of the coefficients of the selected equation are known to be zero. Under the assumption of the knowledge of all variables in the system and the assumption that the disturbances in the equations of the system are normally distributed, point estimates are derived from the regressions of the jointly dependent variables on the predetermined variables (Theorem 1). The vector of the estimates of the coefficients of the jointly dependent variables is the characteristic vector of a matrix involving the regression coefficients and the estimate of the covariance matrix of the residuals from the regression functions. The vector corresponding to the smallest characteristic root is taken. An efficient method of computing these estimates is given in section 7. The asymptotic theory of these estimates is given in a following paper [2]. When the predetermined variables can be considered as fixed, confidence regions for the coefficients can be obtained on the basis of small sample theory (Theorem 3). A statistical test for the hypothesis of over-identification of the single equation can be based on the characteristic root associated with the vector of point estimates (Theorem 2) or on the expression for the small sample confidence region (Theorem 4). This hypothesis is equivalent to the hypothesis that the coefficients assumed to be zero actually are zero. The asymptotic distribution of the criterion is shown in a following paper [2] to be that of \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$.},
