# Motivation:

.pull-left[
### Gun Violence in the US:
  - 2021: Most gun fatalies ever (Pew Research Center)
  - 2022: 647 mass shootings (Gun Violence Archive)
  - All-time high mistrust of police (Washington Post)]

.pull-right[
### Solution?
  - ShotSpotter Technology
    - Gunshot dectection
    - "Colorblind"
  - Widespread (150+ cities)
    - Our setting: Chicago
  - Costly: $11 million a year
]

--

### <font color="blue">**Research Question**</font>: 
### How does investment in ShotSpotter affect the time allocation of scarce police resources ?

- Priority 1 (immediate dispatch): 911 Call-to-dispatch / Call-to-on-scene

---
# What is ShotSpotter and how does it work?

```{r, out.width = "850px", out.height = "550px", fig.align="center"}

```

# Why do we care about response times?

.font130[
> “If police can arrive within one minute of the commission of an offense, they are more likely to catch the suspect. Any later and the chances of capture are very small, probably less than one in ten.”- (Baley 1996)
]

--

### Support for Reponse Times:
.font110[
- Lower response times results in:
    - Less likelihood of an injury (DeAngelo et al. 2023)
    - Higher crime clearance (Blanes i Vidal and Kirchmaier 2018)
- Rapid response  most important (College of Policing 2013)
]
---
# Why would ShotSpotter affect response times?


.pull-left[

### Police Forces:
  - A fixed amount of daily resources
  
### ShotSpotter Resource-Intensive:
  - Respond to every alert (Priority 1)
  - ~60 ShotSpotter dispatches a day
  - ~20 minutes inspecting the scene

### Time Wasted?
 - Does this time investment come at the expense of other important 911 calls?

# Summary of Paper:

--
.pull-left[
## Setting: 
  - Chicago: 2016-2022
    - Second largest police force
    - Third largest city

## Data:
 - All 911 call dispatches from Chicago
 - Merge with:
  - Police shifts
  - Crime/arrest/victimization data
  - ShotSpotter alerts
]

--
.pull-right[
## Empirical Strategy:
  - Staggered difference-in-difference
    - Variation: ShotSpotter rollouts across police districts
  

## Main Results:
  - For Priority 1 911 calls:
    - +1 minute call-to-dispatch (23%)
    - +2 minutes call-to-on-scene (14%)
  - Lower arrest rates (5%)
  - Lower gun victimization (16%)

# ShotSpotter in Chicago:
.pull-left[
### Staggered Rollout
 - 12 of 22 police districts in 2017-2018
 
### High Priority
  - Priority 1 (immediate dispatch)
      - Active shooter, domestic disturbance
      - ~5% of all Priority 1 dispatches
  - Same operating procedure as 911 
      - No specialized response team

# Estimation Strategy:
### Specification (OLS):

$$Y_{d,t} = \beta ShotSpotterEnacted_{d,t}  + \gamma_{d} + \delta_t + \lambda \mathbb{X}_{d,t} + \epsilon_{d,t}$$ 
--

* $Y_{d,t}$ is an outcome of average <b>daily</b> time (in seconds) in police district $d$ in time $t$ 
  - Priority 1 911 Call-to-Dispatch/911 Call-to-On-Scene
* $ShotSpotterEnacted_{d,t}$ is the binary treatment
* $\gamma_d$ is a police district-specific fixed effect
* $\delta_t$ is a day-by-month-by-year fixed effect
* $\mathbb{X}_{d,t}$ is a vector of controls:
    - Officer hours, number of 911 calls (by priority)
* Standard errors clustered by police district
*  $\beta$ interpretation: <font color="blue"> average change in average daily response time </font>

## Robustness:
- Sample Selection:
  - Remove 2020 (Covid)
  - Add in outliers
  - Remove shots fired calls
  - Remove never-treated
- Leave-one-out


## Heterogeneity:
- Priority 2 (rapid dispatch)
- Priority 3 (routine dispatch)
  - Similar results (trickle-down effect)

.pull-right[
## Intensive Margin:
- Alternative Variation: Alerts
  - (RHS): Gunshot alert $\rightarrow$ random event
  - 1 additional alert = +6/+10 seconds to dispatch/on-scene

## Cost-Benefit Analysis
- In progress
