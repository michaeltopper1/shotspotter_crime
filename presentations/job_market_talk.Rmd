# Motivation:

.pull-left[
### AI in the Workforce:
  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) $\rightarrow$ police forces
  - License plate readers, facial recognition, predictive policing
  - AI changes officer production function]

.pull-right[
### ShotSpotter Technology
  - Gunshot detection
  - Police respond to all detections
  - Rationale: only 12% of gunfire reported (Carr and Doleac, 2017) $\rightarrow$ method to respond to others 
]

--

### <font color="blue">**Research Question**</font>: 
### How does the implementation of ShotSpotter technology affect Priority 1 911 call response times?

---
# Why would ShotSpotter affect response times?

.pull-left[
### Resource-Intensive:
  - Respond to every detected gunfire 
  - Chicago: ~70 daily dispatches, 20 min.
  - Priority 1 - equivalent to active shooter
  
### Police Scarcity:
  - A fixed amount of daily resources

### Unintended consequences?
 - Does this reallocation affect 911 call response times?

# Why do we care about response times?

.font120[
> “If police can arrive within one minute of the commission of an offense, they are more likely to catch the suspect. Any later and the chances of capture are very small, probably less than one in ten.”- (David H. Baley 1996) 
]

--

### Evidence:
- Lower response times results in:
    - Higher crime clearance (Blanes i Vidal and Kirchmaier 2018)
    - Less likelihood of an injury (DeAngelo et al. 2023)
- Response $\rightarrow$ important component of investigation (College of Policing 2013)
- Health implications
    - Delayed treatment $\rightarrow$ worse patient outcomes (Wilde, 2013, Avdic, 2016)

# Estimation Strategy:
### Specification (OLS):

$$\text{ResponseTime}_{cdt} = \beta \text{ShotSpotter}_{dt}  + \eta_{\bar{c}} + \delta_{d} + \gamma\mathbb{X}_{f(t)} +  \varepsilon_{cdt}$$
--

* $\text{ResponseTime}_{cdt}$ is call $c$ in police district $d$ in time $t$.
* $\text{ShotSpotter}_{dt}$ is the binary treatment
* $\eta_{\bar{c}}$ is a call-type fixed effect
* $\delta_{d}$ is a police district-specific fixed effect
* $\mathbb{X}_{f(t)}$ is a vector of time-varying controls:
    - Hour-of-day and day-by-month-by-year
* Standard errors clustered by police district
* <font color="blue"> Intuitively, this is estimating the average change in response times on days with ShotSpotter accounting for expected differences in districts/time/call-types. </font>

# Potential Threats to Identification:

--

#### 1. Violation of Common Trends:
  * .font80[Event studies] 
  * .font80[Rambachan and Roth (2023) sensitivity analysis]

--

#### 2. Change in dispatching procedures/call-types post-implementation:
  * .font80[Standard operating procedures same for Priority 1 911 calls]
  * .font80[Specific call-type analysis]

--

#### 3. Other policies that coincide that may affect response times:
  * .font80[Strategic Decision Support Centers (SDSC) and Body-Worn Cameras (BWC)]

--

#### 4. OLS with staggered rollouts:
  * .font80[Two-stage difference-in-differences (Gardner 2022) similar to Borusyak et al. (2021)]

# Mechanism

# Potential Mechanism:

<font color="blue"><b>ShotSpotter expands an officer's responsibilities and incapacitates them from attending to other tasks.</b></font>

#### 1. Extensive Margin: Estimate most resource-constrained times 
  - .font80[Split by police-district median number of officer hours]
  - .font80[Separate by shift-type]
    
#### 2. Intensive Margin: Use ShotSpotter dispatches as intensity measure 
  - .font80[If we can assume the number of alerts within a district day is random, the following will estimate the marginal effect of an extra ShotSpotter dispatch:]

$$\text{ResponseTime}_{cdt} = \beta \text{NumberSSTDispatches}_{dt}  + \eta_{\bar{c}} + \delta_{d} + \gamma\mathbb{X}_{f(t)} +  \varepsilon_{cdt}$$

  - $\text{NumberSSTDispatches}_{dt}$ .font80[is number of ShotSpotter dispatches in a police-district]
  - .font80[Restrict to only treated periods]

# Heterogeneity 

---
# Two Types of Heterogeneity Analysis:

## 1. Analyze specific call-types
  - Analyze a specific call for the most frequent offenses
  - Large health implications with emergency medical services/domestic calls

## 2. Split by priority of call
  - A 'trickle down' effect in Priority 2, suggestive for Priority 3
  - No time for high priority == no time for lower priorities
  - Lends to the idea that officers are facing more responsibilities than they can handle

# Intended Consequence?

---
# Possible Benefits?

## Does ShotSpotter provide benefits?

* Analyze the probability of a victim injury
    - Following DeAngelo et al. (2023)

## New Restrictions:

* Restrict data to only *unrealized* events $\rightarrow$ police intervention may affect outcome
* Examples: 
  * Include: 'Call for Help' $\rightarrow$ unrealized
  * Exclude: 'Person Shot' $\rightarrow$ realized
* Main Result: Suggestive (not conclusive!) evidence of lower injury probability, driven by gun-related calls

# Conclusion:

### Main Takeaways:

- An in-depth analysis on consequences of ShotSpotter:
    - Unintended Consequences:
      - Higher response times 
          - Call-to-Dispatch (+1 minute/ 23% increase)
          - Call-to-On-Scene (+2 minutes/ 13% increase)
      - Lower arrest rates  (8% decrease)
    - Intended Consequence:
          - Suggestive evidence of effectiveness in probability of gun-related victim injury
- Mechanism: incapacitation and misallocation of officer resources
    - More officers needed to mitigate unintended consequences
- Other recommendations appreciated
