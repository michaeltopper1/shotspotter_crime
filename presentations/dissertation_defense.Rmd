# Chapter 1: The Unintended Consequences of Policing Technology: Evidence from ShotSpotter
with Toshio Ferrazares

---
# Motivation

.pull-left[
### Technology in Police Departments:
  - Substitutes $\rightarrow$ License plate readers, facial recognition 
  - Complements $\rightarrow$ predictive 'hotspot' policing 
  - Technology changes officer time allocation]

--

.pull-right[
### ShotSpotter Technology
  - Gunshot detection
  - Rationale: only 12% of gunfire reported (Carr and Doleac, 2017) $\rightarrow$ method to rapidly respond to others 
  - 150+ cities world-wide
]

--

### <font color="blue">**Research Question**</font>: 
### How does the implementation of ShotSpotter technology affect 911 call response times?

* How does a police officer's time allocation change s.t. it affects response?
---
# Why would ShotSpotter affect response times?

.pull-left[
### Resource-Intensive
  - Respond to every detected gunfire 
  - Chicago: ~70 daily dispatches, 20 min.
  - High priority: same as active shooter
  
### Police Scarcity
  - Fixed resources $\Rightarrow$ trade-offs

### Unintended consequences?
 - Ex-ante ambigious; does proximity or time allocation prevail?

# Why do we care about response times?

.font120[
> “If police can arrive within one minute of the commission of an offense, they are more likely to catch the suspect. Any later and the chances of capture are very small, probably less than one in ten.”- (David H. Baley 1996) 
]

--

### Evidence
- Lower response times results in
    - Higher crime clearance (Blanes i Vidal and Kirchmaier 2018)
    - Less likelihood of an injury (DeAngelo et al. 2023)
- Rapid response $\rightarrow$ important component of investigation (College of Policing 2013)
- Health implications
    - Delayed treatment $\rightarrow$ worse patient outcomes (Wilde, 2013, Avdic, 2016)

--

* $\text{ResponseTime}_{cdt}$ is call $c$ in police district $d$ in time $t$.
* $\text{ShotSpotterActivated}_{dt}$ is the binary treatment
* $\eta_{\bar{c}}$ is a call-type fixed effect
* $\delta_{d}$ is a police district-specific fixed effect
* $\mathbb{X}_{f(t)}$ is a vector of time-varying controls:
    - Hour-of-day and day-by-month-by-year
* Standard errors clustered by police district
* <font color="blue"> Intuitively, estimation of parameter $\beta$ gives the average change in response times on days with ShotSpotter accounting for expected differences in districts/time/call-types. </font>

- Find a determinant of response times

## Main Findings: Longer Response
- Call-to-Dispatch (+1 minute/ 23%)/ Call-to-On-Scene (+2 minutes/ 13%)
    - Longer response times $\Rightarrow$ lower arrest likelihood  (9% decrease)
    
## Mechanism: Resource Constraint

- More officers needed to mitigate unintended consequences

# How would gunshot noise affect birth outcomes?

Gunshot noise creates stress which is detrimental to in utero development. But what is the <font color="blue"> net effect?</font>
--
.pull-left[
## Detrimental Effects:
  - Gunshot noise is salient (158 db)
  - Stress stimulates corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), adverse infant health outcomes (Hobel & Culhane, 2003; Black et al., 2016)
  - Mass shootings results in worse birth outcomes (Dursun, 2019, Banerjee and Bharati 2020; Currie et al., 2023)
 
]

--
.pull-right[
## Mitigating Effect:
  - Motivate mothers to seek more care (Torche and Villarreal 2014; Lichtman-Sadot et al., 2022)
    - Prenatal visits
    - Omit commuting to work
    - Concentrated among high-education

# Challenges and Contributions

There are challenges to studying how stressors, and in particular, gunshot noise, can affect birth outcomes:

.panelset.sideways[
.panel[.panel-name[Challenge 1]
<font color="blue"> Challenge 1: Gunshots require reporting, which is under-reported. </font>
- Only 12% of gunshots are reported (Carr and Doleac 2016)
- <font color="blue">Solution:</font> use ShotSpotter technology data
    - Allows for automated gunshot detection
    - Company claims 97% accuracy
    - Previously used for measures of underlying crime/mistrust (Carr and Doleac 2018; Ang et. al 2021)
]

.panel[.panel-name[Challenge 2]
<font color="blue"> Challenge 2: Finding fine, geographic data on stressors. </font>
- Others look at broadly defined county-level stressors (Dursun, 2019; Banerjee and Bharati, 2020)
    - Saliency issue
- <font color="blue">Solution:</font> map gunshot locations to census blocks
  - Census block finest level of geographic variation
  - Mean census block size: 141
]

.panel[.panel-name[Challenge 3]
<font color="blue"> Challenge 3: Frequent documented stressors are rare, and hard to randomly assign. </font>
- Others focus on highly acute and relatively rare instances; mass shootings (Soni and Tekin, 2020; Cabral et al., 2020)
- Saliency may be an issue if combined with county-level data
- <font color="blue">Solution:</font> gunshot noise is relatively frequent, salient, and conditional on location and time, exogenous

# Estimation Strategy
### Specification (OLS):

$$Y_{ict}=\beta Gunshot_{ct}+\gamma X_{ict}+\pi_c+\rho_{t} +\upsilon_{ict}$$
--

* $Y_{ict}$ is outcome for mother $i$ in census block $c$ in month-year $t$.
* $Gunshot_{ct}$ is the binary treatment if at least one gunshot occurred during pregnancy 
* $X_{ict}$ is a vector of observable mother characteristics
* $\pi_c$ is a census block specific fixed effect
* $\rho_{t}$ are month-by-year fixed effects
* Standard errors clustered by census block
* <font color="blue"> We will restrict to only mothers who reside in census blocks that experience at least 1 gunshot detection throughout the sample period. </font>

# Mechanism: In Utero Stress 

### Gunshot Noise Causes Stress
  - Reason for education disparity?
  - $\uparrow$ care (Torche and Villarreal 2014; Lichtman-Sadot et al., 2022)

--

### Analysis:
 - New outcomes for differences in care/behaviors:
    - Smoking: smoke during pregnancy
    - Prenatal Care: number of visits
    - Delayed Care: care only in last 2 trimesters

--

### Results:
- Little evidence of behaviors change
- Caveat: self-reported outcomes

---
# Conclusion

### Contribution
 - Novel linkage of data at fine geographic level to find evidence of new stressor
 
### Results
  - Increases in Very Low Birthweight and Very Preterm Birth
  - Results concentrated in low-education 
  - Driven by at-home hours

### Suggestions?
  - Little evidence of change in prenatal care/behaviors

# Chapter 2: The Effect of Fraternity Moratoriums on Alcohol Offenses and Sexual Assaults

forthcoming Journal of Human Resources

---
# Background: A wide-spread tradition

## Benefits of Fraternities:
  - Community service, volunteering, graduation rates, and future income ([Mara, Davis, and Schmidt 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/coep.12249); [Hayek et. al. 2002](https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/handle/2022/24308); [Asel, Seifert, Pascarella 2009](https://scholarworks.wm.edu/oracle/vol4/iss2/2/))

--

## Downsides of Fraternity Membership:
  - Risky Behavior (e.g., hazing, sexual assault) ([Hechinger 2017](https://www.amazon.com/True-Gentlemen-Broken-America%C2%92s-Fraternities/dp/1610396820); [Seabrook 2019](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07448481.2019.1679153); [Minow and Einolf 2009](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1077801209334472))
  - Binge drinking and college partying ([DeSimone 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167629607000069); [Routon and Walker 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214804314000147))
  - Access to alcohol for lower classmen ([Armstrong, Hamilton, and Sweeney 2006](https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-abstract/53/4/483/1711176?redirectedFrom=fulltext))

Recently, campus administrators began to use temporary campus-wide bans of fraternity social events with alcohol (moratoriums) to change behavior.

--

<font color="blue">**Question**</font>: How do these moratoriums affect alcohol offenses and sexual assaults?

---

# Moratoriums

--

## Moratorium Definition:

A temporary <font color="blue">*campus-wide*</font> halt on fraternity social events with alcohol.
  - Applies to Interfraternity Council fraternities (IFC) $\rightarrow$ primary type of social fraternity.


--

## Moratorium Triggers:
  - Death of a member <font color="blue">(20%)</font>
  - Sexual assault allegation <font color="blue">(22%)</font>
  - Behavior violation (hazing etc.) <font color="blue">(43%)</font>
  - Unspecified <font color="blue">(13%)</font>
  
---

# Research Question

### Question: 
* How do fraternity moratoriums affect campus-wide police reports of alcohol offenses and sexual assault?

### Novel Data: 
* Construct data set from Daily Crime Logs from university-specific police departments (2014-2019).

### Identification: 
* Exploit the variation in timing of the moratoriums using a difference-in-differences design.

---
# Results: Alcohol Offenses

```{r, out.width = "850px", out.height = "550px", fig.align="center"}

# Results: Sexual Assaults

```{r, out.width = "850px", out.height = "550px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures_frats/event_study_sex.jpeg")
```

---
# Conclusion

### Contribution:
* First study to estimate the causal effects of fraternity moratoriums.
* I construct a novel dataset. 

### Results:
  * Find <font color="blue">27%</font> decrease in alcohol offenses $\rightarrow$ effects are transient.
  * Suggestive evidence of decreases in reports of sexual assaults 
  (<font color="blue">26%</font>) on weekends.
  * Possible mechanism is displacement of crime to safer areas .

### Future Work:
* Potential research $\rightarrow$ deferred recruitment/barring of singular fraternities.
