## code

Contains three subfolders that are imperative to the project:

* clean_dispatches - cleans all the dispatches
* clean_shifts - cleans all the shifts data
* create_analysis_panels - once cleaning is finished, this folder contains code to create the main data sets

Note: all other files beginning with the name "clean" only clean the raw data sets. No final analysis data is made here. All cleaning files (except the create_analysis_panels files) go to the created_data folder.
